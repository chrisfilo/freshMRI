freshOSX 001: introduction, getting to the command line
----------  

If you are a whiz-bang programmer, you can probably skip the rest of this part (unless you want to help make it better!), but if you're not familiar with using a Command Line Interface (CLI), there's no time like the present...

For the completely CLI-naive, here's a nice quick and dirty intro to the CLI from [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything).  

To go a little more in depth, check out the FSL-hosted [Basic Unix Tutorial](http://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/unix_intro/) (it gets advanced pretty quickly). Here are some of the bare bones:

## Terminal.app  

There are plenty of alternatives to Terminal.app, the command line interface (CLI) that comes standard with OS X, but unless you have a strong alternate preference already, this one is pretty great.  

![/Applications/Utilities/Terminal]({{ site.url }}/images/Terminal_Finder.png)

You can change the appearance of the Terminal window in Preferences-> Settings (I like 'Homebrew' or 'Pro'). It's good idea to keep the Terminal app in your dock or somewhere else that's easy to access, as we'll be using it a lot.

In your Terminal window, there's a prompt on the left-most side of the screen that says something like 'RickyMcMRI's-MacBook-Pro:~ricky' (the specifics aren't important).  

Code blocks use a '$' or '>' to indicate the prompt, but if you try to copy/paste:  

{% highlight bash %}
$ echo 'freshMRI is totally blowing my mind'
{% endhighlight %}  

into the terminal, you'll get something like:  

{% highlight bash %}
-bash: $: command not found
{% endhighlight %}  

On freshMRI, we'll use [@franklinwebber](https://twitter.com/franklinwebber)'s fancy Terminal code blocks to represent both input and output.  

'$' indicates the prompt.  

Anything after the '$' is input.  

Anything in darker grey on a line without a '$' is output.  

Copy/pasting from code from code blocks is great, that's why we use em', but be judicious (i.e., don't copy the '$' or the output)!  
  
See if you can make your terminal window match: 

{% terminal bash %}
$ echo 'freshMRI is totally blowing my mind'
freshMRI is totally blowing my mind
{% endterminal %}  

Most of the code blocks in freshMRI will be copy/paste-able directly into your command window.
