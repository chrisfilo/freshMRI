#### Top Secret Abstract
  The methodological approaches typically employed in developmental neuroimaging investigations always seems to be a year or two behind contemporary advances in the field. As the pace of emerging techniques continues to accelerate, this lag becomes more and more evident. However, there are a number of factors what make developmental projects poised to disproportionately benefit from collaborative data and code sharing efforts. Because many results are framed in terms of developmental categories, fine grained information about the precise chronological ages of participants is often lost in the wash of 'children,' 'adolescent,' and 'adult.' By making the data associated with these conclusions publicly available, we can facilitate large-scale meta-analysis that give us a more robust understanding of continuous neural development. Variability in analytic techniques employed further obfuscates precise developmental details, but providing detailed instructions for the implementation of data processing pipelines along with the results they yield can not only address this problem, but also provide a valuable didactic instructional resource (let's get opinionated).


  Conclusions about developmental differences are often/typically drawn from samples in which the 'adult' cohort is comprised of participants in their late teens and early twenties, many of our treat emerging adulthood as a static maturational endpoint, rather than the distinct and dynamic epoch we know it to be.
