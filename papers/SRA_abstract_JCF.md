#### Top Secret Abstract

Approaches to neuroimaging in developmental neuroscience (DNS) often lag behind contemporary advances in the field. As the pace of emerging techniques continues to accelerate, this lag becomes more and more evident. However, the unique challenges faced by developmental researchers put us in a position to disproportionately benefit from cutting edge methodologies. Collaborative on-line data and code sharing among DNS researchers would greatly increase the ease of evaluating analyses, transmitting methodologies, and enabling projects too big for any single lab. Variability in analytic techniques between studies obfuscates precise developmental details, but providing detailed instructions for the implementation of data processing pipelines along with the results they yield could not only address this problem, but also provide a valuable didactic instructional resource, promoting methodological progress and refinement. Furthermore, individual studies are often framed in terms of developmental categories with fine grained information about the precise chronological ages of participants lost in the wash of 'child,' 'adolescent,' and 'adult.' Data sharing would allow us to make use of data across studies to make inferences about developmental trajectories, influences, and individual differences that would otherwise not be possible. This manuscript will lay out the benefits of massive online data and code sharing, provide suggestions for ways to minimize risks and promote contributions, and finally, will provide descriptions of and access to tools for implementing this project.
