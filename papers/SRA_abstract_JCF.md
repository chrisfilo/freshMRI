#### Top Secret Abstract

Neuroimaging methodology in developmental neuroscience (DNS) often lags behind contemporary advances in the field. As the pace of emerging techniques continues to accelerate, this methods gap becomes more and more evident. However, the unique challenges faced by developmental researchers actually put us in a position to disproportionately benefit from adopting several cutting edge approaches to neuroimaging. Collaborative online data and code sharing among DNS researchers would greatly enhance the evaluation and refininement of our analyses, transmission of our methods, and enable us to take on massive projects that outstrip the capabilities of any one lab in isolation. Variability in paradigms, operationalized defitions, and analytic techniques often  obfuscate developmental conclusions, but providing detailed instructions for the implementation of experimental designs and data processing pipelines along with the results they yield could not only begin to address this problem, but also provide a valuable didactic resource, promoting methodological progress and refinement. Individual studies are often framed in terms of developmental categories with fine grained information about the precise chronological ages of participants lost in the wash of 'child,' 'adolescent,' and 'adult.' Wide-scale data sharing would allow us to sample across studies, making robust inferences about developmental trajectories, influences, and individual differences that would otherwise not be possible. This manuscript will describe the benefits of open source approaches to sharing data and computational resources, provide suggestions for ways to minimize risks and promote contributions, and finally, will provide descriptions of and access to tools that facilitate the adoption of such meta-analytic techniques.
