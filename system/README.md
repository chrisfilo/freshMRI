freshMRI - system: README.md
==========

Free and open source tools for neuroimaging data analysis are easier to obtain and use than ever before, but if you're coming to the table with questions like "what the heck is a shell script?" (like I did), setting up your computer so that all the tools work in harmony can be a major hurdle.

The code in the 'system' folder is designed to assuage the confusion and/or frustration involved in _getting ready_ to do some science (there is no panacea insofar as the confusion/frustration involved in _doing_ said science).
